Publishing to github.
Still a major work in progress - many bugs and unfinished features.  (I'm looking at you CD playback.)
 
Rolling up previous updates:

The sloppiest WMA playback integration you've ever seen.  Making things worse...
Internal refactoring to enable D2D rendering.  Fixing bugs. Optimising rendering somewhat.  Player.NET.3 not ready at all.
Shell integration seems to be working.  Some optimisation - might be a bit bad...

Added really crappy playlist randomiser, because I got sick of the order of my playlist.  :)
The randomiser isn't stable, I need to fix that.
